        <description>&lt;p&gt;《學而》&lt;br&gt;
1 子曰：「學而時習之，不亦說乎？有朋自遠方來，不亦樂乎？人不知而不慍，不亦君子乎？」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 有子曰：「其為人也孝弟，而好犯上者，鮮矣；不好犯上，而好作亂者，未之有也。君子務本，本立而道生。孝弟也者，其為仁之本與！」
Xue Er:
The philosopher You said, &amp;ldquo;They are few who, being filial and fraternal, are fond of offending against their superiors. There have been none, who, not liking to offend against their superiors, have been fond of stirring up confusion. The superior man bends his attention to what is radical. That being established, all practical courses naturally grow up. Filial piety and fraternal submission! - are they not the root of all benevolent actions?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;1 子曰：“学而时习之，不亦说乎？有朋自远方来，不亦乐乎？人不知而不愠，不亦君子乎？”&lt;br&gt;
2 有子曰：“其为人也孝弟，而好犯上者，鲜矣；不好犯上，而好作乱者，未之有也。君子务本，本立而道生。孝弟也者，其为仁之本与！”&lt;br&gt;
3 子曰：“巧言令色，鲜矣仁！”&lt;br&gt;
4 曾子曰：“吾日三省吾身：为人谋而不忠乎？与朋友交而不信乎？传不习乎？”&lt;br&gt;
5 子曰：“道千乘之国：敬事而信，节用而爱人，使民以时。”&lt;br&gt;
6 子曰：“弟子入则孝，出则弟，谨而信，泛爱众，而亲仁。行有馀力，则以学文。”&lt;br&gt;
7 子夏曰：“贤贤易色，事父母能竭其力，事君能致其身，与朋友交言而有信。虽曰未学，吾必谓之学矣。”&lt;br&gt;
8 子曰：“君子不重则不威，学则不固。主忠信，无友不如己者，过则勿惮改。”&lt;br&gt;
9 曾子曰：“慎终追远，民德归厚矣。”&lt;br&gt;
10 子禽问于子贡曰：“夫子至于是邦也，必闻其政，求之与？抑与之与？”子贡曰：“夫子温、良、恭、俭、让以得之。夫子之求之也，其诸异乎人之求之与？”&lt;br&gt;
11 子曰：“父在，观其志；父没，观其行；三年无改于父之道，可谓孝矣。”&lt;br&gt;
12 有子曰：“礼之用，和为贵。先王之道斯为美，小大由之。有所不行，知和而和，不以礼节之，亦不可行也。”&lt;br&gt;
13 有子曰：“信近于义，言可复也；恭近于礼，远耻辱也；因不失其亲，亦可宗也。”&lt;br&gt;
14 子曰：“君子食无求饱，居无求安，敏于事而慎于言，就有道而正焉，可谓好学也已。”&lt;br&gt;
15 子贡曰：“贫而无谄，富而无骄，何如？”子曰：“可也。未若贫而乐，富而好礼者也。”子贡曰：“《诗》云：‘如切如磋，如琢如磨。’其斯之谓与？”子曰：“赐也，始可与言诗已矣！告诸往而知来者。”&lt;br&gt;
16 子曰：“不患人之不己知，患不知人也。”&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;《學而》&lt;br&gt;
1 子曰：「學而時習之，不亦說乎？有朋自遠方來，不亦樂乎？人不知而不慍，不亦君子乎？」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 有子曰：「其為人也孝弟，而好犯上者，鮮矣；不好犯上，而好作亂者，未之有也。君子務本，本立而道生。孝弟也者，其為仁之本與！」
Xue Er:
The philosopher You said, &amp;ldquo;They are few who, being filial and fraternal, are fond of offending against their superiors. There have been none, who, not liking to offend against their superiors, have been fond of stirring up confusion. The superior man bends his attention to what is radical. That being established, all practical courses naturally grow up. Filial piety and fraternal submission! - are they not the root of all benevolent actions?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 有子曰：「其為人也孝弟，而好犯上者，鮮矣；不好犯上，而好作亂者，未之有也。君子務本，本立而道生。孝弟也者，其為仁之本與！」
Xue Er:
The philosopher You said, &amp;ldquo;They are few who, being filial and fraternal, are fond of offending against their superiors. There have been none, who, not liking to offend against their superiors, have been fond of stirring up confusion. The superior man bends his attention to what is radical. That being established, all practical courses naturally grow up. Filial piety and fraternal submission! - are they not the root of all benevolent actions?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

1 子曰：「學而時習之，不亦說乎？有朋自遠方來，不亦樂乎？人不知而不慍，不亦君子乎？」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 有子曰：「其為人也孝弟，而好犯上者，鮮矣；不好犯上，而好作亂者，未之有也。君子務本，本立而道生。孝弟也者，其為仁之本與！」
Xue Er:
The philosopher You said, &amp;ldquo;They are few who, being filial and fraternal, are fond of offending against their superiors. There have been none, who, not liking to offend against their superiors, have been fond of stirring up confusion. The superior man bends his attention to what is radical. That being established, all practical courses naturally grow up. Filial piety and fraternal submission! - are they not the root of all benevolent actions?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Math Typesetting</title>
        <link>https://davidguo.cc/p/math-typesetting/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://davidguo.cc/p/math-typesetting/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Mathematical notation in a Hugo project can be enabled by using third party JavaScript libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example we will be using &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://katex.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;KaTeX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a partial under &lt;code&gt;/layouts/partials/math.html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within this partial reference the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://katex.org/docs/autorender.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Auto-render Extension&lt;/a&gt; or host these scripts locally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include the partial in your templates like so:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; or .Params.math .Site.Params.math &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; partial &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;math.html&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; . &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; end &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To enable KaTex globally set the parameter &lt;code&gt;math&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; in a project&amp;rsquo;s configuration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To enable KaTex on a per page basis include the parameter &lt;code&gt;math: true&lt;/code&gt; in content files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Use the online reference of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://katex.org/docs/supported.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Supported TeX Functions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Emoji Support</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://davidguo.cc/p/emoji-support/the-creative-exchange-d2zvqp3fpro-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Emoji Support" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emoji can be enabled in a Hugo project in a number of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/functions/emojify/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;code&gt;emojify&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; function can be called directly in templates or &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/templates/shortcode-templates/#inline-shortcodes&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Inline Shortcodes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enable emoji globally, set &lt;code&gt;enableEmoji&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; in your site&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;configuration&lt;/a&gt; and then you can type emoji shorthand codes directly in content files; e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Emoji cheat sheet&lt;/a&gt; is a useful reference for emoji shorthand codes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N.B.&lt;/strong&gt; The above steps enable Unicode Standard emoji characters and sequences in Hugo, however the rendering of these glyphs depends on the browser and the platform. To style the emoji you can either use a third party emoji font or a font stack; e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;.emoji {
  font-family: Apple Color Emoji, Segoe UI Emoji, NotoColorEmoji, Segoe UI Symbol, Android Emoji, EmojiSymbols;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Written in Go, Hugo is an open source static site generator available under the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/blob/master/LICENSE&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
